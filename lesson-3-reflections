When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Because keeping it remote serves many benefits like ease in sharing code with others, or make changes in the code from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because if by mistake i wrote some undesirable stuff to GitHub or someone else did it for malicious reasons, it may save a whole lot trouble, if things were to sync up automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch is a new squence of commits in the same repository. Needed when some tweaks are tried on the same code.
    clone are a complete replica of a repository whether local or from GitHub. Needed when whole lot changes are to be made min the repositry or when using someone else's repositry.
    fork is also a complete replica, with some added features, like it keeps a track from where this repositry is taken or automatically creates a remote space with fetch and push addresses.
